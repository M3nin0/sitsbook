Petabytes of Earth observation (EO) data are now open and free, making the full extent of image archives available. From these big EO data sets, users can extract satellite image time series, which are  sequences of satellite images taken over the same area at different times. These time series can range from days to decades. They are a powerful tool for observing the Earth's surface and its changes over time, enabling insights and analysis that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with single snapshots.   Using image time series, analysts make best use of big Earth observation data collections, capturing subtle changes in ecosystem health and condition and improving the distinction between different land classes.

Satellite image time series refer to sequences of satellite images taken over the same area at different times. These time series can range from days to decades, depending on the frequency of satellite passes and the objectives of the monitoring effort. They are a powerful tool for observing the Earth's surface and its changes over time, enabling insights and analysis that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with single snapshots.

### Why Satellite Image Time Series are Relevant:

1. **Environmental Monitoring and Climate Change**: Time series are crucial for tracking environmental changes, such as deforestation, desertification, and the melting of ice caps. They provide clear evidence of climate change and help in understanding its impacts on natural ecosystems.

2. **Agriculture**: Satellite time series can monitor crop health, growth stages, and overall agricultural productivity. This information is vital for farmers to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting times, leading to more efficient and sustainable farming practices.

3. **Urban Planning and Development**: As cities grow and landscapes change, satellite imagery can track these transformations, aiding in urban planning and the management of resources. It allows planners to observe trends in urban sprawl, infrastructure development, and land use changes.

4. **Disaster Response and Management**: Following natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, time series imagery can assess damage, monitor recovery efforts, and plan for disaster resilience and mitigation strategies.

5. **Water Resources Management**: By monitoring changes in water bodies, ice cover, and water flow, satellite imagery supports the management of water resources, crucial for drinking water, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation.

6. **Biodiversity Conservation**: These images help in tracking changes in habitats and biodiversity, identifying threats to ecosystems, and monitoring the effectiveness of conservation efforts.

7. **Security and Surveillance**: Time series can be used for border monitoring, maritime surveillance, and tracking movements in sensitive areas, contributing to national security.

8. **Scientific Research**: Researchers use satellite time series to study various Earth science phenomena, including ocean currents, atmosphere changes, and geological transformations.

Satellite image time series offer an unparalleled view of the Earth's surface over time, providing critical data for a wide range of applications that impact society, the environment, and the global economy. Their relevance continues to grow as we face global challenges like climate change, natural resource depletion, and urban expansion.

This book introduces `sits`, an open-source **R** package for land use and land cover classification of big Earth observation data using satellite image time series. Users build regular data cubes from cloud services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Planetary Computer, NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel, Brazil Data Cube, Swiss Data Cube, and Digital Earth Africa. The `sits` API includes an assessment of training sample quality, machine learning and deep learning classification algorithms, and Bayesian post-processing methods for smoothing and uncertainty assessment. To evaluate results, `sits` supports best practice accuracy assessments.

## Who this book is for {-}

The target audience for `sits` is the community of remote sensing experts with Earth Sciences background who want to use state-of-the-art data analysis methods with minimal investment in programming skills. The package provides a clear and direct set of functions, which are easy to learn and master. Users with a minimal background on **R** programming can start using `sits` right away. Those not yet familiar with **R** only need to learn introductory concepts.  

If you are not an **R** user and would like to quickly master what is needed to run `sits`, please read Parts 1 and 2 of Garrett Golemund's book, [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/). If you already are an **R** user and would like to update your skills with the latest trends,  please read the book by Hadley Wickham and Gareth Golemund, [R for Data Science (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Important concepts of spatial analysis are presented by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand in their book [Spatial Data Science](https://r-spatial.org/book/).
